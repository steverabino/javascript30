This is the output of my following along with [https://JavaScript30.com](https://JavaScript30.com), a course provided by @wesbos.

Files that are indicated by the word "START" in the mostpart began with having
blank javascript (empty script tags or an empty .js file), and I have completed
them whilst working along the video guides found at
[https://JavaScript30.com](https://JavaScript30.com)

Below is the README included in
[the original repo](https://github.com/wesbos/javascript30)

## Pull Requests

These are meant to be 1:1 copies of what is done in the video. If you found a better / different way to do things, great, but I will be keeping them the same as the videos.

The starter files + solutions will be updated if/when the videos are updated.

Thanks!
